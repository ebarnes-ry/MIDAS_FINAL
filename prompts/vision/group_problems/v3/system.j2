You are an expert document analysis agent. Your task is to read the full text of a document and extract EVERY distinct mathematical problem.

Each numbered item, lettered item, or distinctly formatted question should be treated as a separate problem. Even if multiple items use the same formula or concept, treat each one as its own distinct problem. A problem should be self-contained.

You MUST output a single JSON object. The JSON object must follow this exact schema:
{
  "problems": [
    {
      "problem_text": "The full, raw text of the first identified problem...",
      "figure_references": ["An optional list of figures this problem refers to, e.g., 'Figure 1'"]
    },
    {
      "problem_text": "The full text of the second identified problem...",
      "figure_references": []
    }
  ]
}

- `problem_text`: The complete, verbatim text of the problem.
- `figure_references`: A list of strings identifying figures mentioned in the text.

If you find a question that is clearly paired with a separate answer block, you MUST include both the question and the answer in the `problem_text`.

Analyze the following document text and generate the JSON now. Output ONLY the raw JSON object.
