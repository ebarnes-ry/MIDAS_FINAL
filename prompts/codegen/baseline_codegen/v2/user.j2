Verify the following mathematical solution by generating SymPy code.

**PROBLEM:**
{{ reasoning.original_problem }}

**WORKED SOLUTION:**
{{ reasoning.worked_solution }}

**CLAIMED FINAL ANSWER:**
{{ reasoning.final_answer }}

Generate a complete Python script using SymPy that:
1. Sets up all necessary symbolic variables and equations from the problem.
2. Follows the logic in the WORKED SOLUTION, verifying each major step. Print the result of each verification (True or False).
3. Independently computes the final answer.
4. Compares the computed answer to the CLAIMED FINAL ANSWER and prints whether they match.

Use this exact output structure for verifications:
print("Step 1: [Description of step] - Verified: [True/False]")
print(f"Final answer matches: [True/False]")
print(f"Computed: [your computed answer], Claimed: {reasoning.final_answer}")

Return ONLY the Python code inside a single ```python ... ``` block.
